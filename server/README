Bang Russian Roulette (server) - online multiplayer game.

Developed with:
- Scala 2.11.8;
- Akka 2.4.5;
- Hibernate 3.6.10;
- AndroMDA 3.4;
- Pushka Json 0.6.0;
- Protobuf 3.0.0-beta-3 commit [2fe0556];

Project structure:
- common: planned to use as artifact between many systems;
- core: server core artifact with all game logic;
- mda: artifact that generates classes from UML diagram for Hibernate;
- war: artifact that build WAR file that next deploy to Glassfish server;
- protomessages: here stored source of Proto messages that next generates to the classes;

Setup your PC:
- download and install Java JDK >= 1.8 http://www.oracle.com/
- download and install Maven (this need to build Protobuf) https://maven.apache.org/
- download and install Gradle (this nedd to build our server application) http://gradle.org/
- clone Protobuf https://github.com/google/protobuf
- (optional) build Protobuf protoc compiler, copy build-protobuf-iphonesim.sh into Protobuf directory and run it, this file builds static library for iOS, in my case it is placed at '/usr/local/platform/i386-sim/lib/' create symbolic link to Protoc compiler from '/usr/local/platform/i386-sim/bin/protoc' into '/usr/local/bin/protoc'

Build hibernate classes from UML diagramm use command:
gradle brr-mda:generate

Build Protobuf client/server classes from proto files:
gradle genProto

Build WAR file:
gradle brr-war:war
